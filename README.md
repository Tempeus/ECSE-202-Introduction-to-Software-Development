# McGill ECSE 202 Assignments

Assignment 1:
We must create a java applet simulates Newton's Law of a ball dropping from a specified height and bouncing as soon as it hits the floor, while taking energy loss into account. 

Assignment 2:
We must recreate the simulation in assignment 1 but this time we simulate multiple balls dropping at once

Assignemnt 3: 
we must recreate the simulation in assignment 2 while also implementing a sorting algorithm that sorts all the balls from decreasing to increasing as soon as the simulation completes. 

Assignment 4:
We must recreate the same simulation in assignment 1 and 2 while also implementing a user interface that can change the number of balls, the speed of the ball, the energy loss, the size of the ball and etc. In addition, users are able to interact with the environment by dragging balls and dropping them elsewhere. 

Assignment 5:
Using the C language, we must create a program that can convert a decimal number into any base. 

Assigment 6: 
Using the C language, we must create a student database while also being able to read a textfile with all the student informations on it.
